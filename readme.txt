Directly access and store Media Library files on cloud Object Stores.

== Description ==

### Media Library
This plugin enables WordPress to *directly* store and retrieve media files from cloud object stores such as OpenStack Swift, Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. 

### Requirements
The plugin has been tested only with the dirty cheap [OVH Public Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ovh.ie/cloud/storage/object-storage.xml) which is built on standard OpenStack.

- OpenStack's Identity API v2.0
- PHP >= 7.0
- write access to /wp-admin/includes/file.php to monkey patch it (see MediaStoragePlugin.monkeyPathHandleUpload )

### Limitations
The plugin is stil in early development and as such only supports a limited set of features (based on the author's needs). Contributions are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/ettoredn/wp-media-storage).
- OpenStack's Swift is the only object store
- [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/) command to upload existing is still work in progress
- PHP <= 5.6.x not supported as the author likes to be on the bleeding edge
- you may experience very slower media uploads depending on the perfomance of your object store (available bandwidth and file size)

### Roadmap
- Support OpenStack's Identity v3.x
- wp-cli command to upload existing media
- Amazon S3 support
- Google Storage Support

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin acccess files directly from the object store? =

You bet.

= Why after activating the pluging my uploads are slower? =

Because there is a lot of overhead involved in directly accessing the data on the object store versus local file system.
However, performance should mostly be bound to the network/storage speed of your object store.
